## What does it do?

DMable is an app made to solve the issue lazy people have when they want to send a dm to an unknown number. If you are also super lazy you can use this app to send location to your food delivery driver, send documents to HR, send memes to randos, get reported as a scammer, get banned for life, become sad.... I am trailing off the point here. Its a good app trust me.
